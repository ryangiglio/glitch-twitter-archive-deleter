  <h1>Twitter Archive Deleter</h1>
  <h2>Instructions - Registering a developer account</h2>
  <p>Before you can give this app access to delete your tweets, you need to
  register with Twitter as a developer. It's a pretty striaghtforward form, but
  I've laid out each step for you here:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Log in to Twitter</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Go to https://developer.twitter.com/</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click Apply in the main nav</p><img src="/img/credentials-1.png">
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click the "apply for a developer account" button</p>
      <p>Basically, Twitter wants you to prove you're a real person and explain
      to them what you're doing with the API. I'm going to make this as easy as
      possible for you and give you text to copy/paste right in</p><img src=
      "/img/credentials-2.png">
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Twitter requires developers to have a verified phone number,
      ostensibly to have a point of contact in case of abuse. If you're
      comfortable giving Twitter your phone number, go for it. If not, there
      are a number of services that let you generate temporary phone numbers,
      although I can't vouch for any of them and it might be risky to
      permanently tie your account to a burner number out of your control.
      Ultimately it's up to you. Your best bet is probably to add your real
      phone number and then if you want, remove it from your account when
      you're done using this app.</p><img src="/img/credentials-phone1.png">
      <img src="/img/credentials-phone2.png">
      <p>Click "Continue" to associate your current username.</p><img src=
      "/img/credentials-3.png">
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Select "I am requesting access for my own personal use."</p><img src=
      "/img/credentials-4.png">
      <p>In the "Account name" box, fill in your Twitter username.</p><img src=
      "/img/credentials-5.png">
      <p>Select your country.</p><img src="/img/credentials-6.png">
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Select "Other" as your use case.</p><img src="/img/credentials-7.png">
      <p>In the "Describe in your own words what you're building" box, feel
      free to enter your own explanation or copy/paste this text that already
      meets their minimum text requirement:</p>
      <blockquote>
        1. I'm using Twitter's API to programmatically delete my own Twitter
        archive.<br>
        2. I do not plan to analyze Tweets, Twitter users, or their
        content.<br>
        3. I will not be Tweeting, Retweeting, or liking content.<br>
        4. I will not be displaying any data, I'm just using the API for
        programmatic access to my own tweets.
      </blockquote><img src="/img/credentials-8.png">
      <p>Choose "No" for the question about information being available to
      government entities.</p><img src="/img/credentials-9.png">
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Scroll through and accept the terms and conditions. If you feel like
      reading them, they're actually pretty plain English.</p><img src=

      <p>Twitter will now send you a verification email to complete your
      application</p><img src="/img/credentials-11.png">
      <p>When you recieve it, click the "Confirm your email"
      button</p><img src="/img/credentials-12.png">
