# So you want to delete your tweets

Great! Let's get started.

## Setup

### (Optional) Sign up for Glitch

You _can_ setup and run this app without signing up for Glitch, but if there's an issue and you need to come back later and resume deleting, making an account will make sure your stuff is saved and that it picks up from where it left off. Up to you

### Download your Twitter archive

1. Go to your Twitter [account settings](https://twitter.com/settings/account)
2. Scroll down to "Your Tweet archive" and click the "Request your archive" button
3. Wait to get an email from Twitter. It takes longer if you have a lot of tweets, but in my experience not usually more than an hour
4. Follow the link in your email and download your archive from the page
5. Unzip the archive (it'll have a long name of letters and numbers) and open the folder
6.
